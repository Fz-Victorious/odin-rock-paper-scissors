# OVERVIEW

To create our first programme with javascript, we're going to make an implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”.
Here are the steps we follow to do so:
# Fisrt step:
Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function that will randomly choose either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. We use this function in the game to make the computer’s play.

# Second step:
addEventListner to listen to the user click on a specific button to make his choice, and write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors, the function should take two parameters, the user choice and the computer choice to compare and decide if the user "win" or "lose" or it's a "tie".

# Third step:
play five rounds to decide whose the final winner depending on his score!
